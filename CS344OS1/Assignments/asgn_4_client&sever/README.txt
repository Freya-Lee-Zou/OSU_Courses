1: To compile 5 object files use command: make all or make  
1.1: you also can compile 5 objects file by using command: ./compileall

2: Delete 5 object files use command: make clean

3: To run p5testscript and print the result on terminal use command: ./p5testscript RANDOM_PORT1 RANDOM_PORT2 (two ports should be not the same number)

4: To run p5testscript and store the result to mytestresults file use command: ./p5testscript RANDOM_PORT1 RANDOM_PORT2 > mytestresults 2>&1 (two random ports shouldn't be the same)


========================================= Hint(attetion Please)=========================
when you run my program by compiling p5testscript, the last two sections are prolonged (Section1: #20 POINTS: concurrent test of encryption - look for 4 properly-sized ciphertext# files, or 5 where the 5th is 0 bytes   Section 2: #15 POINTS: concurrent test of decryption - look for 4 plaintext#_a files that match the plaintext# files), please wait for 1 minute until it finishes running.Thanks for your time!
